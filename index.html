                        <p><strong>Andrej Jokiƒá</strong> PhD, Full Professor, University of Zagreb, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture</p>
                        <p>There exists a widely recognized need to better understand and manage complex large-scale dynamical networks, such as "smart" energy grids, biological networks or automated highways. Complexity, large-scale, interconnection/communication constraints and often non-existence of a suitable global model (e.g, due to confidentiality issues), require development of analytical and computational methods for tractable analysis and controller synthesis under structural constraints (e.g., plug-and-play requirements; structured stability/performance conditions; decentralized or distributed controllers). The key challenge is to develop a suitable framework which enables us to efficiently cope with inherent efficiency-robustness-scalability trade-offs in both analysis and control synthesis.</p>
                        <p>In this talk we will address some of the above challenges in parallel with presenting several results regarding structured stability and performance conditions for dynamical networks. We argue that dissipativity theory is an appropriate approach as it offers both distributed/decentralized stability/performance conditions which can be interpreted in terms of protocols imposed on subsystems in a network. Trade-offs are discussed together with the notion of differential supply rates which offer novel structured stability conditions based on storage functions with higher order derivatives. We make the connection between structure of Lyapunov functions (structure that reflects the topology of the considered network) and certain robustness properties of the network.</p>

                        <p>Over the past century, the complexity of a man-made systems has increased significantly, and with it the need for their control. Furthermore, with the development of electronic technologies, data describing system behavior has become increasingly available, which has caused a shift in the research community's focus towards data-driven control methods, compared to classical model-based control methods. Data-driven control methods are suitable when it is difficult to model systems using physical laws due to system complexity, a proven classical example being PID control. A distinguishing feature of this "new wave" of data-driven methods is the emphasis on solutions and techniques with provable guarantees regarding the (robust) stability and performance of the considered (closed-loop) systems. In this presentation, we present results that contribute to this area of research, concerning data-driven controller synthesis methods for discrete-time linear time-invariant systems. The goal of the synthesis is to render the closed-loop system dissipative with respect to a given, generic, unstructured quadratic supply function.</p>

                                <p>This lecture examines how classical control theory can be applied to achieve dynamic stability and environmental interaction in aerial vehicles equipped with multi-degree-of-freedom (DoF) manipulators. Key topics include the stabilization of aerial platforms using Lyapunov-based Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) and the coordination of manipulator movement for precise object interaction.
                                    A unified dynamic model for aerial robots will be introduced, covering various actuation principles such as tilting propellers and centroid variation methods, including moving masses and robotic manipulators. The lecture will also discuss classical control structures through practical examples, including pick-and-place, insertion, and valve-turning tasks.
                                    Beyond object manipulation, the session will cover applications in contact-based surface inspection, demonstrating how an impedance controller can regulate end-effector forces to ensure stable surface interaction. Real-world challenges and solutions for achieving robust aerial manipulation will be discussed, providing a foundation for future advancements in the field.</p>

                                <p>This lecture examines the role of control in enabling robots to replicate human skills, with a focus on deep micro-hole drilling in the glass container mold industry. A robotic framework is introduced that captures and reproduces expert human drilling techniques using a specialized mechanical and software setup for on-site task recording. The lecture further explores control strategies for achieving high-precision, human-like performance in robotic drilling. A single-degree-of-freedom (DOF) impedance-based drill controller is developed for an industrial position-controlled robot, facilitating safe and smooth interactions between the drill bit and the mold. By modeling the relationship between joint and tool dynamics, the proposed control system minimizes non-axial motion, outperforming standard low-level robot control and enabling the robotic system to exceed human capabilities in deep micro-hole drilling. Bridging the fields of human skill acquisition, robotic motion control, and industrial automation, this lecture highlights experimental validations and real-world applications, offering insights into the future of human-inspired robotic systems.</p>

                                <p>The talk is on a data integrity cyber-attack detection framework based on minimum robust positively invariant sets. A general linear control system with a Kalman filter is considered. The set localization of the state estimator error is taken into account for developing the attack detector. An intelligent attacker algorithm is developed that has access to a subset of signals from the sensor and actuator channel of the control system. It is assumed that the attacker possesses the entire control system model to perform the most proficient attack for a certain set-up of data availability and compromisation. The attacker compromises a set of measurement data under the constraint of remaining non-discovered by the detector. The presented methodology allows assessing the effectiveness of the control system defense achievable in various data integrity attack scenarios. The developed detector and attacker algorithm were implemented on an illustrative example of a power system with two control areas and automatic generation control.</p>

                                <p>Set-theoretic methods are a powerful tool in control theory, used to ensure safety and feasibility across various control system configurations. These methods involve defining sets of feasible system states that represent safe operating conditions or constraints. By analyzing these sets and designing control strategies that adhere to these constraints, control algorithms can ensure that the system operates within designated safe regions.</p>
                                <p>This presentation outlines an approach for characterizing feasible initial states and admissible control input trajectories over a finite-time prediction horizon for a nonlinear control system. An admissible control input trajectory refers to a specific feasible initial state and defines the set of admissible inputs that can be applied throughout the prediction horizon. This enables the system to transition from the initial state to the desired state or trajectory while complying with the imposed constraints. This approach is particularly applicable in Battery Management Systems (BMSs).</p>

The first case study explores an MPC approach designed to minimize switching losses in a two-level synchronous generator side converter (SGSC). The second application presents an MPC solution for stabilizing a tower crane system with variable cable lengths. The final case discusses MPC-based Direct Yaw Moment Control (DYC) of an electric vehicle. Across all three applications, the talk emphasizes the stability methodologies that optimize performance, supported by both simulation and experimental results.</p>
